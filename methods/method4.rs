// All functions defined within an impl block are called associated functions because they’re associated with the type named after the impl. We can define associated functions that don’t have self as their first parameter (and thus are not methods) because they don’t need an instance of the type to work with.

    // 3. Must use `Self`, DONT use `TrafficLight` in fn signatures or body
