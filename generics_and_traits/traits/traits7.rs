// The impl Trait syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax sugar for a longer form, which is called a trait bound.

// When working with generics, the type parameters often must use traits as bounds to stipulate what functionality a type implements.
fn main() {
  assert_eq!(sum(1, 2), 3);
}

// Implement `fn sum` with trait bound in two ways.
fn sum<T>(x: T, y: T) -> T {
  x + y
}
